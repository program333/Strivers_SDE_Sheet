Output: The majority element is: 2

Time Complexity: O(N*logN) + O(N), where N = size of the given array.
Reason: We are using a map data structure. Insertion in the map takes logN time. And we are doing it for N elements. 
So, it results in the first term O(N*logN). The second O(N) is for checking which element occurs more than floor(N/2) times.
If we use unordered_map instead, the first term will be O(N) for the best and average case and for the worst case, it will be O(N2).

Space Complexity: O(N) as we are using a map data structure.
