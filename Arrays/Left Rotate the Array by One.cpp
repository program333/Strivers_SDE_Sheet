/*
Example 1:
Input: N = 5, array[] = {1,2,3,4,5}
Output: 2,3,4,5,1
Explanation: 
Since all the elements in array will be shifted 
toward left by one so ‘2’ will now become the 
first index and and ‘1’ which was present at 
first index will be shifted at last.

  int temp = arr[0]; // storing the first element of array in a variable
  for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {

  }
  arr[n - 1] = temp; // assigned the value of variable at the last index
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {

/*
Output: 2 3 4 5 1

Time Complexity: O(n), as we iterate through the array only once.

Space Complexity: O(1) as no extra space is use
