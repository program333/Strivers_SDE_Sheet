1) Delete from Beginning:
Point head to the next node i.e. second node
    temp = head
    head = head->next
    
Make sure to free unused memory
    free(temp); or delete temp;



2) Delete from End:
Point head to the previous element i.e. last second element
    Change next pointer to null
    struct node *end = head;
    struct node *prev = NULL;
    while(end->next)
    {
        prev = end;
        end = end->next;
    }
    prev->next = NULL;
    
Make sure to free unused memory
    free(end); or delete end;



3) Delete from Middle:
Keeps track of pointer before node to delete and pointer to node to delete
    temp = head;
    prev = head;
    for(int i = 0; i < position; i++)
    {
        if(i == 0 && position == 1)
            head = head->next;
            free(temp)
        else
        {
            if (i == position - 1 && temp)
            {
                prev->next = temp->next;
                free(temp);
            }
            else
            {
                prev = temp;
                if(prev == NULL) // position was greater than number of nodes in the list
                    break;
                temp = temp->next; 
            }
        }
    }
